# Wordbash

## Initial setup

Wordbash is a party game revolving around crazy AI-generated prompts and hilarious human-written responses.
                

You can get started very easily! First, invite your friends to a lobby by sending them a join code.
Then, adjust the game settings depending on how wacky you want the AI's prompts to be and how many prompts each player answers.


Bash your head coming up with the funniest responses to these various AI-generated prompts!
Each prompt that you answer will also be answered by a random friend. Players have limited time to respond, so wordbash quickly!


After everyone is done writing their responses, the voting phase of the game commences. For each prompt, everyone votes on the response
they like more, and these votes award the players who wrote the responses up to 1000 points. If you beat your opponent in votes, you gain 100 points; 
furthermore, if you win all the votes, you get a knockout worth an extra 1000 points!


At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins!
